"The Faire restaurant in Barcelona offers a delightful brunch experience that has something for everyone… who loves vegetarian food. From savory dishes like eggs Benedict, to sweet treats like cheesecakes and fruitbowls. you are sure to find something to satisfy your appetite.

The atmosphere is...both relaxed and inviting, and the staff is friendly and helpful. The decor is modern and stylish yet cozy, with plenty of comfortable seating. 
The food is of excellent quality and expertly prepared. The eggs Benedict that I had, is exceptionally tasty and cooked to perfection. The crepes are also delicious, with a variety of savory and sweet fillings to choose from. 
The drinks selection is also impressive. I am a kombucha fan, so I was happy with my tasteful rosemary, mint, lavender combination. 
Overall, the Faire is a great spot for brunch in Barcelona. The food is top-notch, the drinks are well-crafted, and the atmosphere is relaxed and inviting. Whether you're looking for a leisurely meal or a quick snack, the Faire is sure to please. And next to their customers, they’re also very earth friendly. So it’s a win-win for everyone!More",50,February 2023,COM,Faire Brunch & Drinks
"Enjoyed a delicious brunch here. Chose the ‘Popeye’. Essentially eggs on spinach, avocado on the side. Not easy to make spinach flavoursome but whoever cooked this knew what they were doing. Came with toast on the side. Not just any toast. This was the perfect...grainy wholemeal, toasted to crispy perfection. 
Had a cuppa tea too. Wanted ordinary….not available here! Assam in a test tube to infuse no less. Big bowl of it, on a saucer with various trimmings such as a bit of honey on the spoon with some lavender just in case I wanted to stir it in. Other options on the saucer were a white chocolate button and mint leaf and was that a bit of cinnamon? There was clearly an artist on duty. 
My charming waiter didn’t bat an eyelid  when I asked for a little bit of cold milk on the side. At that point I hadn’t realised quite what I’d ordered so at least I didn’t feel too Philistine-like. 
Then there is the decor……retro heaven. Menu QRs on cassettes/Sophia Loren’s cookery book/flat cap on a hat stand etc. Loved the lighting in particular. 
Just one thing, as per usual
in Barcelona as I was solo I was directed to the area opposite the bar to perch on a stool. Why is this?  I’m not a bird I don’t want to perch. My request for a table was accommodated v courteously though - as was the request by a fellow. I did feel a bit apprehensive that a larger group might come in though and that I may have to move. 
Maybe they knew what they were doing though….I may have ended up staying overnight….the music is fab! I defy anyone not to enjoy it. 
Maybe fewer large tables? Maybe start a campaign against directing solo eaters to perches? This place exudes too much classy perfection for that. 
And, just to hit this point home, every bill paid means a tree is planted! 
Love this place. Only open Thurs-Sun according to the website. Whaaat?!More",50,November 2021,COM,Faire Brunch & Drinks

"I got a glowing recommendation to go here from a friend and I was thoroughly impressed with my experience. The atmosphere was cozy and inviting, with a mixture of vintage and modern décor and the service was warm and friendly. The menu offered a nice...selection of brunch favourites and I decided to go with the avocado toast and tofu scramble with a side salad. It was a generous portion, but the meal didn’t feel heavy, and it was all really fresh and tasty. I also tried an Upraising coffee with active mushrooms and nootropics. Everything was soooo good. Overall, I highly recommend this brunch spot. The food was excellent, the service was great, and the atmosphere was enjoyable.

We chose this restaurant based on the reviews and we don’t regret it at all.

Good value, freshly made for us, piping hot and taste great. Our favourites were the Pulled fiction...& chicky pesto - prefect!! There are a few more options including vegan. Plus chilled beers in the fridge and if you need something sweet they sell cheesecakes in jars.

It’s a takeaway mostly, just a couple of stools whilst you wait for your order. Also there is a park area a few minutes walk away with several benches. 

They haven’t been open long and are clearly working really hard. We are going back to Barcelona soon and will definitely be returning to Tinos.More",50,August 2022,COM,"Tino, esto no es una pizzería"

It was such a treat discovering Tino because I quickly found one of my favorite delicious food places in Barcelona. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The dough is handmade through the day and the tinos are served fresh out of the oven. I...would recommend trying more than one because you will definitely want more. I got the 4 pack and they were so tasty I ate all four! They have options for vegan tinos as well which are just as delicious.

Very  good restaurant and good meat. The waiter Angel was very helpful and friendly.  Worth a visit to try the awesome parillas,40,February 2023,COM,Don Asador
"Small, unassuming restaurant, which I picked based on excellent reviews and didn't disappoint. I booked through a website which offered a 30% discount code which was a bonus, but to be honest the food is worth paying full price! I would recommend pre-booking simply because...it was packed even on a Tuesday night, and isn't a massive restaurant. 

When we arrived the service was friendly and personal, and continued that way the whole meal. I felt like they were genuinely delighted to have us there which makes the experience so much better!

We ordered mixed meats, grilled vegetables and one portion of fries. This was more than enough for two of us, it might even stretch to three! The vegetables selection was cooked beautifully, but the meat. WOW, some of the most delicious steak and other meats I'd ever eaten. The steak was so tender and great quality. 

We had food left over and as we were staying in self catering accommodation they parcelled it up and I took it home. The next day I had a steak sandwich, and the meat actually tasted even better than the day before! 

The toilet is accessible, and everything is on one level. They were welcoming of young families too. One of the best meals I've ever had.More",50,April 2022,COM,Don Asador

"Great little restaurant with friendly, helpful staff and a nice atmosphere. We had the large tasting menu, and all the starters were great. The salmon tartar and the Locavore egg were outstanding - imaginatively presented, fresh and tasty.

Wasn't so impressed by the main courses....The turbot was dry with small bones in it, and it had quite a solid texture, maybe a bit over-cooked, the skin was jelly like and, not sure about the beef stock. The venison ribs were OK, just not special. 

Dessert was a big disappointment. The tiramisu was dry and tasteless, probably the worst tiramisu I've ever had. The cream dessert was OK, a bit heavy. All in all we had a good evening and enjoyed our meal, just a few of the dishes let it down.More",40,February 2023,COM,Locavore Barcelona

"We went there hoping to discover local products during the whole meal but were a bit disappointed... I guess they try to use local products in their plates (though the ""foie mi cuit"" cooked with Coca Cola does not seem very aligned with that philosophy),...and the food was good. 
What was more disturbing was that when I asked for a soft drink, I was only suggested a Fanta or a Nestea... A pity when so many more local and healthier alternatives exist. At least the water was from the tap, hence local ;) 
Service was also a bit weird: e.g. we received an entrance (offered by the restaurant, which is nice) 2 minutes before our plate, which didn't leave us enough time to eat it!

There were 3 of us and we each got the 70EUpp...tasting menu. Every bit was so fresh and unbelievable. The only weird thing is I think they close at 4:00 and took us at 3:30(I didn’t know they closed at 4:00 until we got there). We probably would have ordered more food but one of the chefs rushed out and it just seemed like they wanted to close down which made it difficult to relax. They could not have been any friendlier. The place could not have been any cleaner. If you are used to eating a ton of sushi I could see the tasting maybe not being enough but it was plenty for me. One other difficult thing was the language barrier so just be aware of that if your Spanish isn’t great. But I honestly cannot say enough about this place, such a cool little experience.More",50,November 2022,COM,Jara Sushi Degustación

"My partner and I visited the festaursnt on our first day, but we were very disappointed

We were very hungry and wanted to eat a burger! We arrived there and immediately ordered. The two ‚Cheeseburgers' came after 30 min...
We saw that there was no...cheddar but blue cheese on the burger and we claimed that at the English menu it was written that the burger had cheddar but no blue cheese!
Then the chef came and took our burgers, but only put cheddar on these and didnt took the blue cheese away, so it tasted very bad!
We claimed that it wasnt the burgers that we ordered, but they only apologized and changed nothing!

The manager then contacted us to apogolize and invited us a second time to the restaurant. This time we got the burgers with cheddar and they were really tasty. The waitress was also super friendly. We were then very happy! Thank you!More",50,February 2023,COM,Prado de Flores

"We visited Viana for dinner on a Saturday night and had a lovely time. It definitely deserves all of the positive reviews.

They served the best patatas bravas we had in Barcelona. I’d strongly recommend the salmon from the starters menu too. I’m not crazy...about fish but it was delicious. The steaks for main course were perfectly cooked - they even double checked before the steaks came out that my father wanted his cooked well done (he unfortunately did :D ).  The baked cheesecake on the desert menu was lovely too. 

The staff couldn’t have been better. They were attentive and friendly, but never intrusive.

We had the suggested red wine, the marinated salmon for a shared plate, and each an Argentine steak.  Everything was fantastic.  
The food was perfect,  but more than that, the service was so friendly.   Greeted immediately,  welcomed to Viana, super friendly,  but not overbearing staff.  
I mean...an absolute delight.  Less than 100 euros for a bottle of wine, a shared plate (+ a free delicious pumpkin/cheese appetizer), and terrific steaks.  Truly underrated restaurant.

It was delicious! If I had it to do over I think I would have opted for the smoked salmon version (personal preference), although it doesn’t have bacon in it. 
It’s different to not have a pancake without syrup and the fixins, but they are light and taste so good. They’re thicker than what I had expected, but oh so good.

"We were a group of 6 friends (3 couples) in our 30s catching up after the summer vacations. We were greated at the door by Marc, one of the owners and the heart and soul of the renowned ""b Burger"" and also the newer ""b...Restaurant"". 

The restaurant atmosphere is really welcoming. They showcase a great craft beer selection that they know well so you can ask for recommendations if in doubt. We had some patatas bravas to start with and they were to die for; not only because the sauce was a truly homemade ""brava"" sauce but because the potatoes themselves were cooked to perfection by Chef Albert, the other owner. 

As a main course I had the b-Dali, an awesome 150 g meat patty with foie and confit onion cooked exactly as I requested. My friends tried the b-Pol, b-Mozart and b-Dolce Vita and they were all amazed by the quality of all the ingredients and the meticulous presentation and plating. We ended the meal with their homemade white chocolate cheesecake that was the perfect last touch for a memorable dinner. 

None of us was vegan or vegetarian but they offer a nice selection of vegan burgers and many garden-to-table options that makes the ""b Restaurant"" really friendly for people with dietary requirements. 

The location of the ""b Restaurant"" is perfect as it's just 5 minutes walk from the central Sants Estació train station and it's also just beside the ""Entença"" stop of the blue underground line (L5). The neighbourhood is relaxed but centric at the same time.

Fantastic authentic Spanish tapas meal. Really great service and atmosphere. The waiter even gave us a free plate of food to try on the house and shots at the end of the meal. Great prices and atmosphere. Would 100% recommend.

"Delicious tapas and such a friendly atmosphere! We loved our meal here, from the anchovies to the padron peppers and all the charcuterie in between. My 15 year old is conducting a survey of every jamon croquette in Barcelona; these are the best. Even with...a bottle of cava and multiple rounds of soft drinks for the kids, this was surprisingly inexpensive.  Listen to the owner’s recommendation- the Russian salad was delicious!More",50,February 2023,COM,Bar Xapako

"We were staying in a hotel nearby so decided to try this small place for tapas based on the excellent reviews. We were not disappointed.  Paco was very friendly and made some suggestions.  The food was delicious.  On our first visit we chatted with some...fellows who had been playing cards in the back and who I believe were local, which only helped us to feel more at home. At the end of the meal Paco brought out little glasses of Pacharán.  (We later found a bottle to bring home with us.)  On our second visit we were served by the friendly and helpful Diana. If we find ourselves in Barcelona again, we will look forward to another visit to Bar Xapakó.More",50,December 2022,COM,Bar Xapako

Arrived at 8pm and was greeted and shown to our table. We ordered the spicy potatoes and the crystal bread to start, both were so delicious! Highly recommend ordering the Crystal bread!
