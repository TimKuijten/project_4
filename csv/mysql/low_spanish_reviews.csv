Al llegar tuvimos de una espera de 30mins. en un pasillo muy angosto. Si bien...a nosotros nos ubicaron en una mesa relativamente espaciosa, el lugar en sí no está preparado para recibir muchos comensales, por lo que sentarse en una mesa puede demorar mucho tiempo. Y hay carteles que avisan que no se puede seguir de sobremesa tomando tragos… Sobre las tapas, este fue el promedio de los tres comensales…

The letter is limited in terms of supply and at the same time as they are conceived as tapas what in other places are dishes.

656,683,Jara Sushi Degustación,"Primero y antetodo, disculpas al restaurante por la crítica negativa, es mi primera vez escribiendo un comentario en un restaurante, pero acabamos de salir con mi pareja de cenar y estamos muy decepcionados. Hemos ido a celebrar su cumpleaños.

Al entrar, el restaurante es muy...pequeño y con decoración muy llana. Solamente hay una mesa y luego hay dos barras pequeñas con dos sillas cada una. Ningún problema con esto.

Una vez sentados, vienen a mostrarte los pescados
y lo que tienen hoy en el menú. Te explican que tienen dos menús especiales. Uno de 50€ con 20 piezas y otro de 70€ con 27 piezas. (Bebida a parte).

Pedimos el menú de Omakase de 50€, sugerencia del restaurante. Por desilusión nuestra, todo son makis y solamente un Nigiri. El menú no puede estar formado por solamente makis.

La cualidad de la comida es normal, es correcta. Pero en ningún momento es WOW por el precio.
Las porciones además son muy justas por lo pagado.

En favor a ellos, el servicio es muy bueno. Nos preguntaron si estábamos satisfechos, y les comentamos la verdad, que no.
Como compensación nos regalaron un nigiri de toro.
A su contra, nos sentimos un poco presionados por solamente tener una hora para comer. De ocho a nueve, cuando justamente escogemos comer en la barra porque allí nos dijeron que teníamos más tiempo. 

En resumen, calidad, precio, local no vale los 50€. Y menos para comer cara la pared. Sentí que es un restaurante normal pero nada WOW por lo pagado.

Estoy encantado de pagar cuando la comida, porción o decoración es a nivel. Pero sinceramente y me sabe mal por la crítica al restaurante, no los vale.
De hecho no entendemos como tiene tantas críticas tan positivas. 

Hay muchos mejores restaurantes en Barcelona para comer sushi. Con mayor calidad, cantidad y decoración.

Por último, no entendemos porque te enseñan los pescados al entrar. Tengo la sensación de haber comido mucho arroz y poco pescado. 

Nos quedamos muy decepcionados.

Lo siento por la crítica negativa. 

Un saludoMás",Spanish,"First and before, apologize to the restaurant for negative criticism, it is my first time writing a comment in a restaurant, but we just dated my dinner partner and we are very disappointed.We have gone to celebrate his birthday.

Upon entering, the restaurant is very ... small and with very flat decoration.There is only one table and then there are two small bars with two chairs each.No problem with this.

Once sitting, they come to show you the fish
And what they have today in the menu.They explain that they have two special menus.One of € 50 with 20 pieces and another of € 70 with 27 pieces.(Drink part).

We ask for the € 50 € menu, restaurant suggestion.For ours disappointment, everything is makis and only a nigiri.The menu cannot be formed by Makis.

The quality of food is normal, it is correct.But at no time is Wow for the price.
The portions are also very fair for the paid.

In favor of them, the service is very good.They asked us if we were satisfied, and we told you the truth, no.
As compensation they gave us a Toro Nigiri.
To his against, we feel a little pressed for only having an hour to eat.From eight to nine, when we just chose to eat at the bar because there they told us we had more time.

In short, quality, price, local is not worth € 50.And less to eat the wall.I felt that it is a normal restaurant but nothing was paid.

I am delighted to pay when the food, portion or decoration is at the level.But sincerely and knows me badly for criticism of the restaurant, it is not worth them.
In fact we do not understand how it has as many criticisms so positive.

There are many better restaurants in Barcelona to eat sushi.With higher quality, quantity and decoration.

Finally, we do not understand why fish show you when you enter.I have the feeling of having eaten a lot of rice and little fish.

We were very disappointed.

I'm sorry for negative criticism.

Pedimos el menú de Omakase de 50€, sugerencia del restaurante. Por desilusión nuestra, todo son makis y solamente un Nigiri. El menú no puede estar formado por solamente makis.

La cualidad de la comida es normal, es correcta. Pero en ningún momento es WOW por el precio.
Las porciones además son muy justas por lo pagado.

En favor a ellos, el servicio es muy bueno. Nos preguntaron si estábamos satisfechos, y les comentamos la verdad, que no.
Como compensación nos regalaron un nigiri de toro.
A su contra, nos sentimos un poco presionados por solamente tener una hora para comer. De ocho a nueve, cuando justamente escogemos comer en la barra porque allí nos dijeron que teníamos más tiempo. 

En resumen, calidad, precio, local no vale los 50€. Y menos para comer cara la pared. Sentí que es un restaurante normal pero nada WOW por lo pagado.

Estoy encantado de pagar cuando la comida, porción o decoración es a nivel. Pero sinceramente y me sabe mal por la crítica al restaurante, no los vale.
De hecho no entendemos como tiene tantas críticas tan positivas. 

Hay muchos mejores restaurantes en Barcelona para comer sushi. Con mayor calidad, cantidad y decoración.

Por último, no entendemos porque te enseñan los pescados al entrar. Tengo la sensación de haber comido mucho arroz y poco pescado. 

Nos quedamos muy decepcionados.

Lo siento por la crítica negativa. 

Un saludoMás",Spanish,"First and before, apologize to the restaurant for negative criticism, it is my first time writing a comment in a restaurant, but we just dated my dinner partner and we are very disappointed.We have gone to celebrate his birthday.

Upon entering, the restaurant is very ... small and with very flat decoration.There is only one table and then there are two small bars with two chairs each.No problem with this.

Once sitting, they come to show you the fish
And what they have today in the menu.They explain that they have two special menus.One of € 50 with 20 pieces and another of € 70 with 27 pieces.(Drink part).

We ask for the € 50 € menu, restaurant suggestion.For ours disappointment, everything is makis and only a nigiri.The menu cannot be formed by Makis.

The quality of food is normal, it is correct.But at no time is Wow for the price.
The portions are also very fair for the paid.

In favor of them, the service is very good.They asked us if we were satisfied, and we told you the truth, no.
As compensation they gave us a Toro Nigiri.
To his against, we feel a little pressed for only having an hour to eat.From eight to nine, when we just chose to eat at the bar because there they told us we had more time.

In short, quality, price, local is not worth € 50.And less to eat the wall.I felt that it is a normal restaurant but nothing was paid.

I am delighted to pay when the food, portion or decoration is at the level.But sincerely and knows me badly for criticism of the restaurant, it is not worth them.
In fact we do not understand how it has as many criticisms so positive.

There are many better restaurants in Barcelona to eat sushi.With higher quality, quantity and decoration.

Finally, we do not understand why fish show you when you enter.I have the feeling of having eaten a lot of rice and little fish.

We were very disappointed.

I'm sorry for negative criticism.

13756,14003,Billy Brunch & Garden,"Espero sea una crítica constructiva. Para el precio y los comentarios esperábamos muuuuucho más. Suerte que la atención fue muy buena por parte de los trabajadores. 
Tiene unos estándares de producto pésimos, pan de molde del que puedo comprar en el súper, salchichas del súper...reguleras y bacon increíblemente mejorable. El pan de los Benedict, era eso, pan y tranquilamente del que venden en un Carrefour o un Lidl, los huevos crudos, medio minuto más para ese huevo mollet le iría de perlas, la “ensalada” de bolsa sin gracia y la salsa que los cubría la vinagreta del Makro.
Me parece un insulto para el cliente. Con mucho gusto a los dueños les puedo indicar sitios con mejor calidad en la ciudad al mismo precio o menor. Y si necesitan inspiración los sundays brunch que se marcan los ingleses son excepcionales. De nada sirve haber trabajado en cocinas de hoteles de 5* sino saben comprar para su negocio ni actualizarse.Más",Spanish,"I hope it is a constructive criticism.For the price and comments we expected so much more.Good luck was very good by workers.
It has lousimous product standards, mold bread that I can buy in the super, super sausages ... regulates and incredibly improvable bacon.Benedict's bread, was that, bread and quietly they sell in a Carrefour or a lidl, raw eggs, half a minute for that egg mollet would go from pearls, the “salad” of bag without grace and the sauce thatThey covered the makro vinaigrette.
