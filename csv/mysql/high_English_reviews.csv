18052,18395,Faire Brunch & Drinks,"The Faire restaurant in Barcelona offers a delightful brunch experience that has something for everyone… who loves vegetarian food. From savory dishes like eggs Benedict, to sweet treats like cheesecakes and fruitbowls. you are sure to find something to satisfy your appetite.

The atmosphere is...both relaxed and inviting, and the staff is friendly and helpful. The decor is modern and stylish yet cozy, with plenty of comfortable seating. 
The food is of excellent quality and expertly prepared. The eggs Benedict that I had, is exceptionally tasty and cooked to perfection. The crepes are also delicious, with a variety of savory and sweet fillings to choose from. 
The drinks selection is also impressive. I am a kombucha fan, so I was happy with my tasteful rosemary, mint, lavender combination. 
Overall, the Faire is a great spot for brunch in Barcelona. The food is top-notch, the drinks are well-crafted, and the atmosphere is relaxed and inviting. Whether you're looking for a leisurely meal or a quick snack, the Faire is sure to please. And next to their customers, they’re also very earth friendly. So it’s a win-win for everyone!More",English,"The Faire restaurant in Barcelona offers a delightful brunch experience that has something for everyone… who loves vegetarian food.

18053,18396,Faire Brunch & Drinks,"Enjoyed a delicious brunch here. Chose the ‘Popeye’. Essentially eggs on spinach, avocado on the side. Not easy to make spinach flavoursome but whoever cooked this knew what they were doing. Came with toast on the side. Not just any toast. This was the perfect...grainy wholemeal, toasted to crispy perfection. 
Had a cuppa tea too. Wanted ordinary….not available here! Assam in a test tube to infuse no less. Big bowl of it, on a saucer with various trimmings such as a bit of honey on the spoon with some lavender just in case I wanted to stir it in. Other options on the saucer were a white chocolate button and mint leaf and was that a bit of cinnamon? There was clearly an artist on duty. 
My charming waiter didn’t bat an eyelid  when I asked for a little bit of cold milk on the side. At that point I hadn’t realised quite what I’d ordered so at least I didn’t feel too Philistine-like. 
Then there is the decor……retro heaven. Menu QRs on cassettes/Sophia Loren’s cookery book/flat cap on a hat stand etc. Loved the lighting in particular. 
Just one thing, as per usual
in Barcelona as I was solo I was directed to the area opposite the bar to perch on a stool. Why is this?  I’m not a bird I don’t want to perch. My request for a table was accommodated v courteously though - as was the request by a fellow. I did feel a bit apprehensive that a larger group might come in though and that I may have to move. 
Maybe they knew what they were doing though….I may have ended up staying overnight….the music is fab! I defy anyone not to enjoy it. 
Maybe fewer large tables? Maybe start a campaign against directing solo eaters to perches? This place exudes too much classy perfection for that. 
And, just to hit this point home, every bill paid means a tree is planted! 
Love this place. Only open Thurs-Sun according to the website. Whaaat?!More",English,"Enjoyed a delicious brunch here. Chose the ‘Popeye’. Essentially eggs on spinach, avocado on the side.

When we arrived the service was friendly and personal, and continued that way the whole meal. I felt like they were genuinely delighted to have us there which makes the experience so much better!

We ordered mixed meats, grilled vegetables and one portion of fries. This was more than enough for two of us, it might even stretch to three! The vegetables selection was cooked beautifully, but the meat. WOW, some of the most delicious steak and other meats I'd ever eaten. The steak was so tender and great quality. 

We had food left over and as we were staying in self catering accommodation they parcelled it up and I took it home. The next day I had a steak sandwich, and the meat actually tasted even better than the day before!

The restaurant atmosphere is really welcoming. They showcase a great craft beer selection that they know well so you can ask for recommendations if in doubt. We had some patatas bravas to start with and they were to die for; not only because the sauce was a truly homemade ""brava"" sauce but because the potatoes themselves were cooked to perfection by Chef Albert, the other owner. 

As a main course I had the b-Dali, an awesome 150 g meat patty with foie and confit onion cooked exactly as I requested. My friends tried the b-Pol, b-Mozart and b-Dolce Vita and they were all amazed by the quality of all the ingredients and the meticulous presentation and plating. We ended the meal with their homemade white chocolate cheesecake that was the perfect last touch for a memorable dinner. 

None of us was vegan or vegetarian but they offer a nice selection of vegan burgers and many garden-to-table options that makes the ""b Restaurant"" really friendly for people with dietary requirements. 

The location of the ""b Restaurant"" is perfect as it's just 5 minutes walk from the central Sants Estació train station and it's also just beside the ""Entença"" stop of the blue underground line (L5).

From the moment we walked into the busy restaurant Jordi was just amazing and made us feel so welcome. He...could not do enough for us. We asked him for recommendations and he had so much time for us. He let us have a sample of house wine and the sangria before we bought ( they were both that nice that we bought them both). The food was absolutely stunning as were the drinks, especially the sangria. I would absolutely recommend this hidden little gem to anybody travelling to Barcelona who wants so traditional Spanish food. Between us we had Spanish tapas, paella (seafood and chicken) and we shared the local traditional pudding.

I decided to return as they had a T-Bone Steak at a good price which was also really good and also had a chicken kebab starter and garlic mushrooms. On the second occasion I was looked after by Christal who was also excellent.
