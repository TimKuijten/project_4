7271,7478,Faire Brunch & Drinks,"The Faire restaurant in Barcelona offers a delightful brunch experience that has something for everyone… who loves vegetarian food. From savory dishes like eggs Benedict, to sweet treats like cheesecakes and fruitbowls. you are sure to find something to satisfy your appetite.

The atmosphere is...both relaxed and inviting, and the staff is friendly and helpful. The decor is modern and stylish yet cozy, with plenty of comfortable seating. 
The food is of excellent quality and expertly prepared. The eggs Benedict that I had, is exceptionally tasty and cooked to perfection. The crepes are also delicious, with a variety of savory and sweet fillings to choose from. 
The drinks selection is also impressive. I am a kombucha fan, so I was happy with my tasteful rosemary, mint, lavender combination. 
Overall, the Faire is a great spot for brunch in Barcelona. The food is top-notch, the drinks are well-crafted, and the atmosphere is relaxed and inviting. Whether you're looking for a leisurely meal or a quick snack, the Faire is sure to please. And next to their customers, they’re also very earth friendly. So it’s a win-win for everyone!More",Hindi,"The Faire restaurant in Barcelona offers a delightful brunch experience that has something for everyone… who loves vegetarian food.

7272,7479,Faire Brunch & Drinks,"Enjoyed a delicious brunch here. Chose the ‘Popeye’. Essentially eggs on spinach, avocado on the side. Not easy to make spinach flavoursome but whoever cooked this knew what they were doing. Came with toast on the side. Not just any toast. This was the perfect...grainy wholemeal, toasted to crispy perfection. 
Had a cuppa tea too. Wanted ordinary….not available here! Assam in a test tube to infuse no less. Big bowl of it, on a saucer with various trimmings such as a bit of honey on the spoon with some lavender just in case I wanted to stir it in. Other options on the saucer were a white chocolate button and mint leaf and was that a bit of cinnamon? There was clearly an artist on duty. 
My charming waiter didn’t bat an eyelid  when I asked for a little bit of cold milk on the side. At that point I hadn’t realised quite what I’d ordered so at least I didn’t feel too Philistine-like. 
Then there is the decor……retro heaven. Menu QRs on cassettes/Sophia Loren’s cookery book/flat cap on a hat stand etc. Loved the lighting in particular. 
Just one thing, as per usual
in Barcelona as I was solo I was directed to the area opposite the bar to perch on a stool. Why is this?  I’m not a bird I don’t want to perch. My request for a table was accommodated v courteously though - as was the request by a fellow. I did feel a bit apprehensive that a larger group might come in though and that I may have to move. 
Maybe they knew what they were doing though….I may have ended up staying overnight….the music is fab! I defy anyone not to enjoy it. 
Maybe fewer large tables? Maybe start a campaign against directing solo eaters to perches? This place exudes too much classy perfection for that. 
And, just to hit this point home, every bill paid means a tree is planted!

All the dishes were interesting, original, and delicious ( all portions were small, but...adequate to appreciate the presentation and flavors and sufficiently satisfying).

I booked through a website which offered a 30% discount code which was a bonus, but to be honest the food is worth paying full price! I would recommend pre-booking simply because...it was packed even on a Tuesday night, and isn't a massive restaurant. 

When we arrived the service was friendly and personal, and continued that way the whole meal. I felt like they were genuinely delighted to have us there which makes the experience so much better!

We ordered mixed meats, grilled vegetables and one portion of fries. This was more than enough for two of us, it might even stretch to three! The vegetables selection was cooked beautifully, but the meat. WOW, some of the most delicious steak and other meats I'd ever eaten. The steak was so tender and great quality. 

We had food left over and as we were staying in self catering accommodation they parcelled it up and I took it home. The next day I had a steak sandwich, and the meat actually tasted even better than the day before!

9230,9437,Faire Brunch & Drinks,"Enjoyed a delicious brunch here. Chose the ‘Popeye’. Essentially eggs on spinach, avocado on the side. Not easy to make spinach flavoursome but whoever cooked this knew what they were doing. Came with toast on the side. Not just any toast. This was the perfect...grainy wholemeal, toasted to crispy perfection. 
Had a cuppa tea too. Wanted ordinary….not available here! Assam in a test tube to infuse no less. Big bowl of it, on a saucer with various trimmings such as a bit of honey on the spoon with some lavender just in case I wanted to stir it in. Other options on the saucer were a white chocolate button and mint leaf and was that a bit of cinnamon? There was clearly an artist on duty. 
My charming waiter didn’t bat an eyelid  when I asked for a little bit of cold milk on the side. At that point I hadn’t realised quite what I’d ordered so at least I didn’t feel too Philistine-like. 
Then there is the decor……retro heaven. Menu QRs on cassettes/Sophia Loren’s cookery book/flat cap on a hat stand etc. Loved the lighting in particular. 
Just one thing, as per usual
in Barcelona as I was solo I was directed to the area opposite the bar to perch on a stool. Why is this?  I’m not a bird I don’t want to perch. My request for a table was accommodated v courteously though - as was the request by a fellow. I did feel a bit apprehensive that a larger group might come in though and that I may have to move. 
Maybe they knew what they were doing though….I may have ended up staying overnight….the music is fab! I defy anyone not to enjoy it. 
Maybe fewer large tables? Maybe start a campaign against directing solo eaters to perches? This place exudes too much classy perfection for that. 
And, just to hit this point home, every bill paid means a tree is planted!

The food was amazing, all of the plates we tried were delicious and the attention from...the waiters was perfect. They explained in detail how each dish was prepared, and made sure everything was okay for us.

Absolutely no complaints at all. I would 100% recommend this place. It was a perfect experience for us.

We chose to do...the tasting menu and pair it with a bottle of white Garnacha wine. Every single dish was amazing! You can probably close your eyes and point to an item on the menu and it will come out perfect. Also, don't leave without getting dessert!!!
To complete the trifecta, besides having amazing food and drinks, the ambiance did not leave us wanting. The decoration, music, and lighting of the restaurant were on point. 
If that was not enough, the service was also extremely friendly and helpful. They helped us through all of our choices and made sure our tasting menu came out seamlessly; we never felt rushed and we were never sitting there waiting a long time.

The...service was very nice and humble, since we sat down we got all needed information about the food and drinks. They all looked so happy and had so much positive energy, very friendly! 

She ordered pasta (don't remember the name) but it was really HUGE portion of fresh delicious pasta with some deep flavoured sauce and meat chunks.  She gives it a 10 because it was only like 15€ but it feelt like 25-30€ pasta with that portion! 

I ordered Lasagna (also forgot the name, but the waiter was recommending it). I got schocked when it came fresh inside  ""porcelain?"" baking mold. So tasty with fresh Mozarella and Parmegiano, combined with pork meat was so delicious, yummy, deep in flavours and layed really good down inside my stomach! Also, price was super pleasant. For fresh and deep flavoured lasagna i only paid 15€.

19505,16826,Prado de Flores,"This place was so good I decided to visit a second time.

On the first occasion my friend and I had garlic prawns and croquettes. He then had a fish paella and I had ribs. Jordi our waiter recommended a local white wine that went...with both dishes.

I decided to return as they had a T-Bone Steak at a good price which was also really good and also had a chicken kebab starter and garlic mushrooms. On the second occasion I was looked after by Christal who was also excellent.

Will try to get there again the next time I'm in Barcelona.More",Hindi,"This place was so good I decided to visit a second time.
