7401,7608,Locavore Barcelona,"We went there hoping to discover local products during the whole meal but were a bit disappointed... I guess they try to use local products in their plates (though the ""foie mi cuit"" cooked with Coca Cola does not seem very aligned with that philosophy),...and the food was good. 
What was more disturbing was that when I asked for a soft drink, I was only suggested a Fanta or a Nestea... A pity when so many more local and healthier alternatives exist. At least the water was from the tap, hence local ;) 
Service was also a bit weird: e.g. we received an entrance (offered by the restaurant, which is nice) 2 minutes before our plate, which didn't leave us enough time to eat it!
In conclusion, a good restaurant with a concept only half exploited.More",Hindi,"We went there hoping to discover local products during the whole meal but were a bit disappointed...

Did not love that they had no green tea (unheard of for a Japanese restaurant to not have a hot tea). Did not like that the place was so uncomfortable,...could not wait to leave. Thought WTF with all the stellar reviews? Made me think: what? really? Nevertheless, the servers were nice, friendly.

7554,7761,RAÓ Restaurant,"We visited this place based on TA reviews. It is an upscale tapas bar/restaurant, and the tapas were indeed of good quality but pricey, which I couldn't say about the wine card—very few choices for that price level place. Service was good and fast (almost...too fast) but ambiance was a bit noisy for my taste. I am sure you can find a cheaper option with equally good tapas and better atmosphere in town.More",Hindi,"We visited this place based on TA reviews.

7596,7803,Billy Brunch & Garden,"We had this on our list of breakfast options for the trip so spent our Sunday morning queuing for what we’d read would be a 4.9 treat! 

After a 30 minute queue, we were greeted by the chefs and most of the staff before being...seated inside. ( Definitely opt for outside if you can. Very pretty garden ) The service was 10/10 throughout but sadly the food did not live up to our expectations. I ordered scrambled eggs and they were very dry/ over cooked and my friend had the shakshuka which is usually her favourite breakfast meal, but she only managed to eat her eggs and the piece of baguette she was given, avoiding the sauce which resembled more of a stew. 

We’re both really not that fussy, especially with breakfast, but we left most of it untouched. The staff were v kind and apologetic and we left without a bill.

Such a shame as was really looking forward to it! Great service, great ambience but the food was very average!More",Hindi,"We had this on our list of breakfast options for the trip so spent our Sunday morning queuing for what we’d read would be a 4.9 treat!
