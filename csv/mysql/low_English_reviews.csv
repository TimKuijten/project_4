18143,18486,Kiltro Restobar,"Overall it is a nice place with very friendly staff, but my food was not very enjoyable. My quesadillas were fried so hard they were brownish (who even fries quesadillas this days??) and fish tacos had a not pleasant taste. Food could be better.

18182,18525,Locavore Barcelona,"We went there hoping to discover local products during the whole meal but were a bit disappointed... I guess they try to use local products in their plates (though the ""foie mi cuit"" cooked with Coca Cola does not seem very aligned with that philosophy),...and the food was good. 
What was more disturbing was that when I asked for a soft drink, I was only suggested a Fanta or a Nestea... A pity when so many more local and healthier alternatives exist. At least the water was from the tap, hence local ;) 
Service was also a bit weird: e.g. we received an entrance (offered by the restaurant, which is nice) 2 minutes before our plate, which didn't leave us enough time to eat it!
In conclusion, a good restaurant with a concept only half exploited.More",English,"We went there hoping to discover local products during the whole meal but were a bit disappointed...

18203,18546,Jara Sushi Degustación,"It was freezing in there. Did not enjoy their choice for a loud hiphop music. Did not love that they had no green tea (unheard of for a Japanese restaurant to not have a hot tea). Did not like that the place was so uncomfortable,...could not wait to leave. Thought WTF with all the stellar reviews? Made me think: what? really? Nevertheless, the servers were nice, friendly. Hope your experience is better than mine. -pMore",English,"It was freezing in there. Did not enjoy their choice for a loud hiphop music.

18335,18678,RAÓ Restaurant,"We visited this place based on TA reviews. It is an upscale tapas bar/restaurant, and the tapas were indeed of good quality but pricey, which I couldn't say about the wine card—very few choices for that price level place. Service was good and fast (almost...too fast) but ambiance was a bit noisy for my taste. I am sure you can find a cheaper option with equally good tapas and better atmosphere in town.More",English,"We visited this place based on TA reviews.

18385,18728,Billy Brunch & Garden,"We had this on our list of breakfast options for the trip so spent our Sunday morning queuing for what we’d read would be a 4.9 treat! 

After a 30 minute queue, we were greeted by the chefs and most of the staff before being...seated inside. ( Definitely opt for outside if you can. Very pretty garden ) The service was 10/10 throughout but sadly the food did not live up to our expectations. I ordered scrambled eggs and they were very dry/ over cooked and my friend had the shakshuka which is usually her favourite breakfast meal, but she only managed to eat her eggs and the piece of baguette she was given, avoiding the sauce which resembled more of a stew. 

We’re both really not that fussy, especially with breakfast, but we left most of it untouched. The staff were v kind and apologetic and we left without a bill.

Such a shame as was really looking forward to it! Great service, great ambience but the food was very average!More",English,"We had this on our list of breakfast options for the trip so spent our Sunday morning queuing for what we’d read would be a 4.9 treat!

18415,18758,Gusto,"We arrived at the restaurant and was seated at 9pm (our reservation time), and get this, the paella didn’t arrive until 10:15. I ordered a fried tempura shrimp dish as my children were quite hungry at that time. The waiter got our order wrong and...took a quite combative tone with me when I pointed out on the menu what I had ordered.

We waited and waited for the paella, and I wanted to order a second order of the shrimp because again, very hungry after waiting for so long. The waiter was rude and flat out told me no with hand gesture. I had to get another waitress to get my order in. Overall,  the service was rushed and incredibly slow. The waiter was rude and aggressive.  When I received the bill, there were wrong items (things I didn’t order). 

The shrimp and paella— as late as it was—was delicious.
