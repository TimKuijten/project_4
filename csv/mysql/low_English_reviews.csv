18203,18546,Jara Sushi Degustación,"It was freezing in there. Did not enjoy their choice for a loud hiphop music. Did not love that they had no green tea (unheard of for a Japanese restaurant to not have a hot tea). Did not like that the place was so uncomfortable,...could not wait to leave. Thought WTF with all the stellar reviews? Made me think: what? really? Nevertheless, the servers were nice, friendly. Hope your experience is better than mine. -pMore",English,"It was freezing in there. Did not enjoy their choice for a loud hiphop music.

18411,18754,Gusto,"I booked this restaurant a number of weeks for New Year's Eve.
On the day whilst attending a football game in Camp Nou  I received an email at 14.30pm to say my table was cancelled.
When I phoned to ask why I was told they...were closing at 18.00.
As a result of the late cancellation we couldn't get a booking in another restaurant as others were either fully booked or closed.

18415,18758,Gusto,"We arrived at the restaurant and was seated at 9pm (our reservation time), and get this, the paella didn’t arrive until 10:15. I ordered a fried tempura shrimp dish as my children were quite hungry at that time. The waiter got our order wrong and...took a quite combative tone with me when I pointed out on the menu what I had ordered.

We waited and waited for the paella, and I wanted to order a second order of the shrimp because again, very hungry after waiting for so long. The waiter was rude and flat out told me no with hand gesture. I had to get another waitress to get my order in. Overall,  the service was rushed and incredibly slow. The waiter was rude and aggressive.  When I received the bill, there were wrong items (things I didn’t order). 

The shrimp and paella— as late as it was—was delicious. Kudos to the chef!More",English,"We arrived at the restaurant and was seated at 9pm (our reservation time), and get this, the paella didn’t arrive until 10:15.
