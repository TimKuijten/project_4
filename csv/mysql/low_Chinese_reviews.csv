8515,8722,Don Kilo Gourmet,这一家店的食物同质性太强，拼盘只是披萨馅料堆积而成，没有心意。披萨也烤糊了不少。最重要的是价格太高。,Chinese,"The food of this shop is too strong, and the platter is only accumulated from pizza fillings.Pizza was baked a lot.The most important thing is that the price is too high.",0.659,30,,"['Pizza', 'Southern-Italian']",5.0
8520,8727,Swagatam Bar-Restaurant Hindu,首先，食物不错。咖喱角很好，它让我们燃起了对主菜的希望。我们点了羊肉印度饭，大蒜印度饼，鸡肉和咖喱羊肉。但是，遗憾的是，没有一道菜能达到好的开胃菜所带来的期待。不过，配菜非常好。员工对所有的客人都很友好，很讨人喜欢。,Chinese,"First of all, the food is good.The curry horn is very good, and it makes us hope for the main cuisine.We ordered lamb Indian rice, garlic Indian cakes, chicken and curry lamb.However, unfortunately, there is no expectation that no dish can achieve good appetizers.However, the side dishes are very good.Employees are very friendly and flattering for all guests.",0.8605,30,Into,"['Indian', 'Asian']",4.5

8574,8781,Taps,餐厅很小，但别具特色，服务生也很年轻。我们就坐在后面，挨着厨房，所以能看到所有食物的制作过程。这家餐厅是为游客服务的，提供Tapas的快餐，点单很快，上菜也很迅速。从进门到就餐结束我们花了不到一个小时，这似乎不是品尝Tapas所用的时间。我们点了猪头肉和虾，都很好吃。里脊肉和胡椒非常好吃，但价格昂贵。我会推荐很多当地人常去，价格没有这里昂贵的餐厅，还可以坐在那里花几个小时就餐，不被催促。,Chinese,"The restaurant is small, but it is unique and the waiter is very young.We just sat behind, next to the kitchen, so we could see the process of making all food.This restaurant serves tourists. It provides Tapas fast food. The order is fast and the food is also very fast.It took less than an hour from the entrance to the end of the meal.

8612,8819,Paisano Bistro,我在去Sagrada Familia之前，和朋友一起去吃午饭。我吃了烤宽面条，而我的朋友吃煎蛋卷。我们还分享了一盘玉米片和在菜单上列出的巧克力蛋奶酥(提示:它不是巧克力蛋奶酥)。我的烤宽面条很好。大量的番茄酱、奶酪和猪肉。我的朋友点了鸡蛋，他不吃蘑菇，比起我的千层面，我更喜欢他的鸡蛋。玉米片不错。巧克力蛋奶酥变成了一个融化的巧克力熔岩蛋糕，非常甜，我们只能吃几口。尽管如此，我们还是吃了一顿丰盛的午餐。我有7/10的可能将会建议饥饿的人们去Sagrada Familia。,Chinese,"Before I went to Sagrada Familia, I went to lunch with my friends.I ate the grilled noodles, and my friend ate fried egg rolls.We also shared a plate of corn slices and chocolate egg cream crispy on the menu (tip: it is not chocolate egg cream).My grilled wide noodles are very good.A large amount of tomato sauce, cheese and pork.My friend ordered the eggs.

8614,8821,Paisano Bistro,我们在这里吃了午餐，我怎么也没想到，据业主说这里的餐点是排名第一的，他们是在六个月前买下这家餐厅的。我们点了鳄梨酱和玉米片，据说是自制的，还在商店买了果酱和多力多滋！多力多滋是乳酪的味道，也许是因为它是烤出来的。我们点了三明治，还可以但是并不是很感兴趣。这是我们在巴萨罗那吃过最奇怪的一餐！更多,Chinese,"We had a lunch here. I never expected that according to the owner, the meals here ranked first. They bought this restaurant six months ago.We ordered Hocao sauce and corn slices.

8638,8845,Gusto,去 Gusto 吃过去几年。 很好的披萨，但是它似乎只有他们最棒的菜，高质量的其他变化。 服务一直都很乱，不要期待在这里吃的很快。 然而一年前一个意大利老板要求我们离开桌子，因为我们占用了 20 分钟的座位超过我们吃完饭之后。 我不觉得它公平的，如果我很慢食吗？ 而且这是什么样的服务？ 这是一个如此糟糕的事情。 今天我点了他们的外卖，他们的葡萄酒的时候，没有要求我更换。 便宜的，最糟糕的一个。味道 所以，如果你正在寻找好吃的披萨——尝试一下，但是不要期待很好的服务，从侍者，无论是经常几乎都在尖叫，吵的主人。 不要点外送。更多,Chinese,"Go to Gusto for a few years.Very good pizza, but it seems to only have their best dishes, high -quality other changes.The service has always been messy, don't expect to eat here quickly.However, a year ago, an Italian boss asked us to leave the table because we took up for 20 minutes to surpass our meals.I don't think it's fair, if I eat slowly?And what kind of service is this?This is such a bad thing.Today I ordered their takeaway.
