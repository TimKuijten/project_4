656,683,Jara Sushi Degustación,"Primero y antetodo, disculpas al restaurante por la crítica negativa, es mi primera vez escribiendo un comentario en un restaurante, pero acabamos de salir con mi pareja de cenar y estamos muy decepcionados. Hemos ido a celebrar su cumpleaños.

Al entrar, el restaurante es muy...pequeño y con decoración muy llana. Solamente hay una mesa y luego hay dos barras pequeñas con dos sillas cada una. Ningún problema con esto.

Una vez sentados, vienen a mostrarte los pescados
y lo que tienen hoy en el menú. Te explican que tienen dos menús especiales. Uno de 50€ con 20 piezas y otro de 70€ con 27 piezas. (Bebida a parte).

Pedimos el menú de Omakase de 50€, sugerencia del restaurante. Por desilusión nuestra, todo son makis y solamente un Nigiri. El menú no puede estar formado por solamente makis.

La cualidad de la comida es normal, es correcta. Pero en ningún momento es WOW por el precio.
Las porciones además son muy justas por lo pagado.

En favor a ellos, el servicio es muy bueno. Nos preguntaron si estábamos satisfechos, y les comentamos la verdad, que no.
Como compensación nos regalaron un nigiri de toro.
A su contra, nos sentimos un poco presionados por solamente tener una hora para comer. De ocho a nueve, cuando justamente escogemos comer en la barra porque allí nos dijeron que teníamos más tiempo. 

En resumen, calidad, precio, local no vale los 50€. Y menos para comer cara la pared. Sentí que es un restaurante normal pero nada WOW por lo pagado.

Estoy encantado de pagar cuando la comida, porción o decoración es a nivel. Pero sinceramente y me sabe mal por la crítica al restaurante, no los vale.
De hecho no entendemos como tiene tantas críticas tan positivas. 

Hay muchos mejores restaurantes en Barcelona para comer sushi. Con mayor calidad, cantidad y decoración.

Por último, no entendemos porque te enseñan los pescados al entrar. Tengo la sensación de haber comido mucho arroz y poco pescado. 

Nos quedamos muy decepcionados.

Lo siento por la crítica negativa. 

Un saludoMás",Spanish,"First and before, apologize to the restaurant for negative criticism, it is my first time writing a comment in a restaurant, but we just dated my dinner partner and we are very disappointed.We have gone to celebrate his birthday.

Upon entering, the restaurant is very ... small and with very flat decoration.There is only one table and then there are two small bars with two chairs each.No problem with this.

Once sitting, they come to show you the fish
And what they have today in the menu.They explain that they have two special menus.One of € 50 with 20 pieces and another of € 70 with 27 pieces.(Drink part).

We ask for the € 50 € menu, restaurant suggestion.For ours disappointment, everything is makis and only a nigiri.The menu cannot be formed by Makis.

The quality of food is normal, it is correct.But at no time is Wow for the price.
The portions are also very fair for the paid.

In favor of them, the service is very good.They asked us if we were satisfied, and we told you the truth, no.
As compensation they gave us a Toro Nigiri.
To his against, we feel a little pressed for only having an hour to eat.From eight to nine, when we just chose to eat at the bar because there they told us we had more time.

In short, quality, price, local is not worth € 50.And less to eat the wall.I felt that it is a normal restaurant but nothing was paid.

I am delighted to pay when the food, portion or decoration is at the level.But sincerely and knows me badly for criticism of the restaurant, it is not worth them.
In fact we do not understand how it has as many criticisms so positive.

There are many better restaurants in Barcelona to eat sushi.With higher quality, quantity and decoration.

Finally, we do not understand why fish show you when you enter.I have the feeling of having eaten a lot of rice and little fish.

We were very disappointed.

I'm sorry for negative criticism.

3088,3135,Faire Brunch & Drinks,"Enjoyed a delicious brunch here. Chose the ‘Popeye’. Essentially eggs on spinach, avocado on the side. Not easy to make spinach flavoursome but whoever cooked this knew what they were doing. Came with toast on the side. Not just any toast. This was the perfect...grainy wholemeal, toasted to crispy perfection. 
Had a cuppa tea too. Wanted ordinary….not available here! Assam in a test tube to infuse no less. Big bowl of it, on a saucer with various trimmings such as a bit of honey on the spoon with some lavender just in case I wanted to stir it in. Other options on the saucer were a white chocolate button and mint leaf and was that a bit of cinnamon? There was clearly an artist on duty. 
My charming waiter didn’t bat an eyelid  when I asked for a little bit of cold milk on the side. At that point I hadn’t realised quite what I’d ordered so at least I didn’t feel too Philistine-like. 
Then there is the decor……retro heaven. Menu QRs on cassettes/Sophia Loren’s cookery book/flat cap on a hat stand etc. Loved the lighting in particular. 
Just one thing, as per usual
in Barcelona as I was solo I was directed to the area opposite the bar to perch on a stool. Why is this?  I’m not a bird I don’t want to perch. My request for a table was accommodated v courteously though - as was the request by a fellow. I did feel a bit apprehensive that a larger group might come in though and that I may have to move. 
Maybe they knew what they were doing though….I may have ended up staying overnight….the music is fab! I defy anyone not to enjoy it. 
Maybe fewer large tables? Maybe start a campaign against directing solo eaters to perches? This place exudes too much classy perfection for that. 
And, just to hit this point home, every bill paid means a tree is planted!

3896,3989,Jara Sushi Degustación,"Primero y antetodo, disculpas al restaurante por la crítica negativa, es mi primera vez escribiendo un comentario en un restaurante, pero acabamos de salir con mi pareja de cenar y estamos muy decepcionados. Hemos ido a celebrar su cumpleaños.

Al entrar, el restaurante es muy...pequeño y con decoración muy llana. Solamente hay una mesa y luego hay dos barras pequeñas con dos sillas cada una. Ningún problema con esto.

Una vez sentados, vienen a mostrarte los pescados
y lo que tienen hoy en el menú. Te explican que tienen dos menús especiales. Uno de 50€ con 20 piezas y otro de 70€ con 27 piezas. (Bebida a parte).

Pedimos el menú de Omakase de 50€, sugerencia del restaurante. Por desilusión nuestra, todo son makis y solamente un Nigiri. El menú no puede estar formado por solamente makis.

La cualidad de la comida es normal, es correcta. Pero en ningún momento es WOW por el precio.
Las porciones además son muy justas por lo pagado.

En favor a ellos, el servicio es muy bueno. Nos preguntaron si estábamos satisfechos, y les comentamos la verdad, que no.
Como compensación nos regalaron un nigiri de toro.
A su contra, nos sentimos un poco presionados por solamente tener una hora para comer. De ocho a nueve, cuando justamente escogemos comer en la barra porque allí nos dijeron que teníamos más tiempo. 

En resumen, calidad, precio, local no vale los 50€. Y menos para comer cara la pared. Sentí que es un restaurante normal pero nada WOW por lo pagado.

Estoy encantado de pagar cuando la comida, porción o decoración es a nivel. Pero sinceramente y me sabe mal por la crítica al restaurante, no los vale.
De hecho no entendemos como tiene tantas críticas tan positivas. 

Hay muchos mejores restaurantes en Barcelona para comer sushi. Con mayor calidad, cantidad y decoración.

Por último, no entendemos porque te enseñan los pescados al entrar. Tengo la sensación de haber comido mucho arroz y poco pescado. 

Nos quedamos muy decepcionados.

Lo siento por la crítica negativa. 

Un saludoMás",Spanish,"First and before, apologize to the restaurant for negative criticism, it is my first time writing a comment in a restaurant, but we just dated my dinner partner and we are very disappointed.We have gone to celebrate his birthday.

Upon entering, the restaurant is very ... small and with very flat decoration.There is only one table and then there are two small bars with two chairs each.No problem with this.

Once sitting, they come to show you the fish
And what they have today in the menu.They explain that they have two special menus.One of € 50 with 20 pieces and another of € 70 with 27 pieces.(Drink part).

We ask for the € 50 € menu, restaurant suggestion.For ours disappointment, everything is makis and only a nigiri.The menu cannot be formed by Makis.

The quality of food is normal, it is correct.But at no time is Wow for the price.
The portions are also very fair for the paid.

In favor of them, the service is very good.They asked us if we were satisfied, and we told you the truth, no.
As compensation they gave us a Toro Nigiri.
To his against, we feel a little pressed for only having an hour to eat.From eight to nine, when we just chose to eat at the bar because there they told us we had more time.

In short, quality, price, local is not worth € 50.And less to eat the wall.I felt that it is a normal restaurant but nothing was paid.

I am delighted to pay when the food, portion or decoration is at the level.But sincerely and knows me badly for criticism of the restaurant, it is not worth them.
In fact we do not understand how it has as many criticisms so positive.

There are many better restaurants in Barcelona to eat sushi.With higher quality, quantity and decoration.

Finally, we do not understand why fish show you when you enter.I have the feeling of having eaten a lot of rice and little fish.

We were very disappointed.

I'm sorry for negative criticism.

6696,6847,Faire Brunch & Drinks,"Enjoyed a delicious brunch here. Chose the ‘Popeye’. Essentially eggs on spinach, avocado on the side. Not easy to make spinach flavoursome but whoever cooked this knew what they were doing. Came with toast on the side. Not just any toast. This was the perfect...grainy wholemeal, toasted to crispy perfection. 
Had a cuppa tea too. Wanted ordinary….not available here! Assam in a test tube to infuse no less. Big bowl of it, on a saucer with various trimmings such as a bit of honey on the spoon with some lavender just in case I wanted to stir it in. Other options on the saucer were a white chocolate button and mint leaf and was that a bit of cinnamon? There was clearly an artist on duty. 
My charming waiter didn’t bat an eyelid  when I asked for a little bit of cold milk on the side. At that point I hadn’t realised quite what I’d ordered so at least I didn’t feel too Philistine-like. 
Then there is the decor……retro heaven. Menu QRs on cassettes/Sophia Loren’s cookery book/flat cap on a hat stand etc. Loved the lighting in particular. 
Just one thing, as per usual
in Barcelona as I was solo I was directed to the area opposite the bar to perch on a stool. Why is this?  I’m not a bird I don’t want to perch. My request for a table was accommodated v courteously though - as was the request by a fellow. I did feel a bit apprehensive that a larger group might come in though and that I may have to move. 
Maybe they knew what they were doing though….I may have ended up staying overnight….the music is fab! I defy anyone not to enjoy it. 
Maybe fewer large tables? Maybe start a campaign against directing solo eaters to perches? This place exudes too much classy perfection for that.

Good value, freshly made for us, piping hot and taste great. Our favourites were the Pulled fiction...& chicky pesto - prefect!! There are a few more options including vegan. Plus chilled beers in the fridge and if you need something sweet they sell cheesecakes in jars.

It’s a takeaway mostly, just a couple of stools whilst you wait for your order. Also there is a park area a few minutes walk away with several benches.

The restaurant atmosphere is really welcoming. They showcase a great craft beer selection that they know well so you can ask for recommendations if in doubt. We had some patatas bravas to start with and they were to die for; not only because the sauce was a truly homemade ""brava"" sauce but because the potatoes themselves were cooked to perfection by Chef Albert, the other owner. 

As a main course I had the b-Dali, an awesome 150 g meat patty with foie and confit onion cooked exactly as I requested. My friends tried the b-Pol, b-Mozart and b-Dolce Vita and they were all amazed by the quality of all the ingredients and the meticulous presentation and plating. We ended the meal with their homemade white chocolate cheesecake that was the perfect last touch for a memorable dinner. 

None of us was vegan or vegetarian but they offer a nice selection of vegan burgers and many garden-to-table options that makes the ""b Restaurant"" really friendly for people with dietary requirements. 

The location of the ""b Restaurant"" is perfect as it's just 5 minutes walk from the central Sants Estació train station and it's also just beside the ""Entença"" stop of the blue underground line (L5).

13618,13865,Jara Sushi Degustación,"Primero y antetodo, disculpas al restaurante por la crítica negativa, es mi primera vez escribiendo un comentario en un restaurante, pero acabamos de salir con mi pareja de cenar y estamos muy decepcionados. Hemos ido a celebrar su cumpleaños.

Al entrar, el restaurante es muy...pequeño y con decoración muy llana. Solamente hay una mesa y luego hay dos barras pequeñas con dos sillas cada una. Ningún problema con esto.

Una vez sentados, vienen a mostrarte los pescados
y lo que tienen hoy en el menú. Te explican que tienen dos menús especiales. Uno de 50€ con 20 piezas y otro de 70€ con 27 piezas. (Bebida a parte).

Pedimos el menú de Omakase de 50€, sugerencia del restaurante. Por desilusión nuestra, todo son makis y solamente un Nigiri. El menú no puede estar formado por solamente makis.

La cualidad de la comida es normal, es correcta. Pero en ningún momento es WOW por el precio.
Las porciones además son muy justas por lo pagado.

En favor a ellos, el servicio es muy bueno. Nos preguntaron si estábamos satisfechos, y les comentamos la verdad, que no.
Como compensación nos regalaron un nigiri de toro.
A su contra, nos sentimos un poco presionados por solamente tener una hora para comer. De ocho a nueve, cuando justamente escogemos comer en la barra porque allí nos dijeron que teníamos más tiempo. 

En resumen, calidad, precio, local no vale los 50€. Y menos para comer cara la pared. Sentí que es un restaurante normal pero nada WOW por lo pagado.

Estoy encantado de pagar cuando la comida, porción o decoración es a nivel. Pero sinceramente y me sabe mal por la crítica al restaurante, no los vale.
De hecho no entendemos como tiene tantas críticas tan positivas. 

Hay muchos mejores restaurantes en Barcelona para comer sushi. Con mayor calidad, cantidad y decoración.

Por último, no entendemos porque te enseñan los pescados al entrar. Tengo la sensación de haber comido mucho arroz y poco pescado. 

Nos quedamos muy decepcionados.

Lo siento por la crítica negativa. 

Un saludoMás",Spanish,"First and before, apologize to the restaurant for negative criticism, it is my first time writing a comment in a restaurant, but we just dated my dinner partner and we are very disappointed.We have gone to celebrate his birthday.

Upon entering, the restaurant is very ... small and with very flat decoration.There is only one table and then there are two small bars with two chairs each.No problem with this.

Once sitting, they come to show you the fish
And what they have today in the menu.They explain that they have two special menus.One of € 50 with 20 pieces and another of € 70 with 27 pieces.(Drink part).

We ask for the € 50 € menu, restaurant suggestion.For ours disappointment, everything is makis and only a nigiri.The menu cannot be formed by Makis.

The quality of food is normal, it is correct.But at no time is Wow for the price.
The portions are also very fair for the paid.

In favor of them, the service is very good.They asked us if we were satisfied, and we told you the truth, no.
As compensation they gave us a Toro Nigiri.
To his against, we feel a little pressed for only having an hour to eat.From eight to nine, when we just chose to eat at the bar because there they told us we had more time.

In short, quality, price, local is not worth € 50.And less to eat the wall.I felt that it is a normal restaurant but nothing was paid.

I am delighted to pay when the food, portion or decoration is at the level.But sincerely and knows me badly for criticism of the restaurant, it is not worth them.
In fact we do not understand how it has as many criticisms so positive.

There are many better restaurants in Barcelona to eat sushi.With higher quality, quantity and decoration.

Finally, we do not understand why fish show you when you enter.I have the feeling of having eaten a lot of rice and little fish.

We were very disappointed.

I'm sorry for negative criticism.

Not easy to make spinach flavoursome but whoever cooked this knew what they were doing. Came with toast on the side. Not just any toast.

Had a cuppa tea too. Wanted ordinary….not available here! Assam in a test tube to infuse no less. Big bowl of it, on a saucer with various trimmings such as a bit of honey on the spoon with some lavender just in case I wanted to stir it in. Other options on the saucer were a white chocolate button and mint leaf and was that a bit of cinnamon? There was clearly an artist on duty. 
My charming waiter didn’t bat an eyelid  when I asked for a little bit of cold milk on the side. At that point I hadn’t realised quite what I’d ordered so at least I didn’t feel too Philistine-like. 
Then there is the decor……retro heaven. Menu QRs on cassettes/Sophia Loren’s cookery book/flat cap on a hat stand etc. Loved the lighting in particular. 
Just one thing, as per usual
in Barcelona as I was solo I was directed to the area opposite the bar to perch on a stool. Why is this?  I’m not a bird I don’t want to perch.

Wasn't so impressed by the main courses....The turbot was dry with small bones in it, and it had quite a solid texture, maybe a bit over-cooked, the skin was jelly like and, not sure about the beef stock. The venison ribs were OK, just not special. 

Dessert was a big disappointment. The tiramisu was dry and tasteless, probably the worst tiramisu I've ever had. The cream dessert was OK, a bit heavy.

Then the chef came and took our burgers, but only put cheddar on these and didnt took the blue cheese away, so it tasted very bad!
We claimed that it wasnt the burgers that we ordered, but they only apologized and changed nothing!

The manager then contacted us to apogolize and invited us a second time to the restaurant. This time we got the burgers with cheddar and they were really tasty. The waitress was also super friendly. We were then very happy! Thank you!More",0.9071,50,February 2023,"['Chinese', 'American']",5.0
