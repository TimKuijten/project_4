"Had a wonderful meal here! The best bit was the service! Really friendly guy! Had a great night! Food was lovely, not a massive menu, but had chicken, beef or pulled pork burgers which were lovely! And we tried the chicken wings which were also...delicious! It’s very small so does not always have room! But give it a go!More",50,February 2023,IN,La Gastronomica Burgers
"Incredible burgers. The different kinds of meat were sooo juicy, the local sauces were just special. Everything was neat to the last detail. But the best thing was the friendly staff and their recommendations.",50,February 2023,IN,La Gastronomica Burgers
"Nice burgers in a small setting (roughly a dozen seats inside and a half dozen outside).  Burgers are taste good and are pretty good size (180 g); they come with french fries.  The beer on tap was also good (Alhambra).  Waiter was friendly and good....If you need a burger, I can recommend it -- note prices are those of a high end burger joint.More",40,February 2023,IN,La Gastronomica Burgers
"I'we had lot of burgers in my lifetime (and have even been flipping them myself). And I have to say that the burgers in La Gastronomica were not among the best. They were just... fine. Maybe I had too high hopes because of the high...ratings.

The place itself was small and suitable for a fast eat.More",30,February 2023,IN,La Gastronomica Burgers
"Good option if you are looking for a quality hamburger in the heart of the city. I really liked the bread, and you could tell that the ingredients were very fresh. If you're hungry and in the mood for a good burger, this is your...place. The site looked clean and tidy!More",50,February 2023,IN,La Gastronomica Burgers
"Fantastic burger and excellent service. I recommend trying the habanero chilli sauce.
I went for dinner with family and friends. The guy serving us was really nice.",50,February 2023,IN,La Gastronomica Burgers
"This burger was simple amazing! It’s one of the best we’ve had! We had the BBQ Bacon Cheese and it was cooked to perfection! It wasn’t greasy and the best bit, it had just what was ordered (so not hot lettuce or soggy tomato!). Really...good value for money!

We also had the reasonably priced desserts, the almond cake and the chocolate fondant. Again, absolutely delicious! 

The service by the waiter was considerate and very helpful, we felt at ease with him straightaway and he offered good recommendations!

We cannot recommend a visit to this place enough!More",50,February 2023,IN,La Gastronomica Burgers
one of the best burgers I've ever had. Great meat and lot of various flavours. We have taken BBq and pulled pork burger and both were delicious!,50,February 2023,IN,La Gastronomica Burgers
"We ordered the basic cheeseburger and the bacon cheeseburger. Both were excellent especially when you’ve eaten too much tapas and want something familiar and hearty: The service was personal, waiting staff who spoke fluent English took the time to explain each burger properly.

A very cool and cosy burger joint. Absolutely delicious sandwiches. A must try for burger lovers. Only walk-in no reservations due to the size of the place. Extremely friendly staff. Truly enjoyed it.,50,January 2023,IN,La Gastronomica Burgers

"Joel! What an impression you made on us, your English was brilliant and you was very welcoming and friendly. 

We looked for suggestions on where to eat before coming to Barca and this was at the top and for what someone might call - a...burger connoisseur, I had to stop by. 

Honestly if you want something different, I really recommend the Pulled Pork burger, Joel informed us of the great preparation that the pork goes through and I read through some other reviews after ordering it, I agree with them that it was THE BEST PULLED PORK BURGER IVE EVER HAD. So juicy, fresh, delicious and different. Most places load pulled pork on top of a beef burger but this was purely just pulled pork and you will not be disappointed. 

The burgers come with fries which are fresh, taste great and are not too heavy. 

The atmosphere was nice, the interior designing was cool and a unique place to be. If I find myself in Barca again and fancying a burger, I won’t hesitate to come back. Thanks Joel.More",50,January 2023,IN,La Gastronomica Burgers
"The food was out of this world (to quote my partner). Honestly it was THAT GOOD. I haven’t even left yet at the time of writing this review. 

Honestly, I wish we hadn’t had lunch earlier today, my partner couldn’t eat all of hers and...we both felt bad leaving any on the plate. 

I had a BBQ Bacon Burger and my partner had the Pulled Pork. The food couldn’t have been better. 

The restaurant has a lovely friendly chilled out vibe and serves a range of beers and soft drinks. But the food is honestly to die for. If I came back to Barcelona again, I would definitely re-visit. I only wish I had left time on this trip to check out their other restaurant! 

Wow. Try it. A minimalist menu, cooked to perfection at a very reasonable price. 5/5!More",50,January 2023,IN,La Gastronomica Burgers
"Everything was cooked to perfection. Amazing atmosphere in a cosy restaurant. The burgers were cooking flawlessly. The meat was juicy and succulent. And don’t even get me started about the habanero mayo, words  cannot describe. the flavors were melting on my tongue.  And JUST when...you think nothing can get better there comes Joel. My knight in shining amour, what a man. I tipped him 20% and felt like I did a disservice doing so as his service was as worth way more. This was our last meal in Barcelona, a meal we will never forget. Joel, I miss you I hope to see u againMore",50,December 2022,IN,La Gastronomica Burgers
The food here is amazing! My husband had the blue cheese burger and I had the pulled pork. It was the BEST pulled pork I’ve ever had. Different then American pulled pork and BETTER. The service was excellent! Joel was such a great server and...help!More,50,January 2023,IN,La Gastronomica Burgers
"Unusual and delicious combinations of tastes. Well worth a visit!
While making our reservation we didn't realize all dishes were vegetarian or vegan. That was a pleasant surprise for us flexitarians.

"Having read all the good reviews we decided to give this place a try. My son hadn’t realised it was mainly vegan food but very much enjoyed the “meat” in his rock and roll sushi. My jackfruit burger was also good. We unfortunately had a...very long wait due to a mixup with our order, and would have only given four stars, but (despite us not having complained about the wait) the chef proactively offered us free desserts so they get the extra star back for great customer service.More",50,February 2023,IN,Desoriente

"I was looking for a ""comfy"" place to have dinner with some friends and came across this one. Loved the decoration and atmosphere and our waiter was super friendly. We ordered some starters to share and everyone had a main course. I can highly recommend...the wasabi croquettes and Oishi Broccoli - amazing dishes. 
I like the fact that they only have 3 main dishes to choose from (but if you're a bit picky with food as I am, that might be too little). My friend had Sushi, which was nice but as it's a big amount, it was a little too much of the same taste for her. The Ramen was apparently really good and the Bao was ok. I had the Pad Sa Thai and as I already had a lot of ""peanut"" taste in all other dishes, it was a little too much.
Nonetheless, I def recommend this place. Friendly staff, interesting drinks, amazing starters and good main dishes.More",40,January 2023,IN,Desoriente
"We visited two times during our stay in Barcelona and enjoyed delicious risotto, pastas, and Antipasti:) The service was great and especially the seafood risotto was excellent!! Would highly recommend.

"My husband requested Italian food for his 83rd birthday and Wow! He got it.  Our first visit after many recommended it and we were not disappointed.  Good thing we reserved- the restaurant was packed but not noisy.  People were busy eating.  I had the spinach...lasagna- which was excellent- just a hint of nutmeg in the spinach and yummy cheese topping.  My husband had the tagliatelle with mushroom and truffle.  I think it was the best dish of the night.  Our son ordered a pizza which was good but he said he’s had better but a generous portion.  Our daughter in law also had lasagna but with mushrooms.  I liked hers best.  We split a generous Caprese salad sadly lacking in basil but the amazing tiramisu made up for that.  Very pleasant server and the owner came to the table several times to see how we liked everything. Except that we were a bit cold being close to the front door on a freezing night, a perfect celebration.More",50,January 2023,IN,BelleBuon
"Growing up in NY, my wife and I know Italian food. This is awesome Italian food! Epic. Little Italy, Godfather, Rome. And the owner is a trip. Engaging, fun and playful making excellent wine recommendations with ample tastings. The burrata was unbelievable. My wife loved...her pumpkin ravioli. as did I. I savored every bite of my lasagna and reluctantly shared it. I can still taste it. It is the standard for all lasagnas to come. Definitely worth the trip.More",50,December 2022,IN,BelleBuon

"The experience in this restaurant was very good. The menu is big, the food is fresh and delicious. The staff is very friendly, helpful and professional. The portions are large and the wine is good. Really enjoyed lasagna with porcini mushrooms and truffle. 
The only...thing is that place is so popular that you need to book it in advance but it's so worth it.More",50,November 2022,IN,BelleBuon
"Absolutely amazing meal. I chose this based on the Tripadvisor reviews, and didn’t book as I didn’t think it would be too busy at 7pm. I dragged my reluctant family up there amidst much moaning and we arrived just as they opened up. All the...tables inside the restaurant were booked and we were lucky enough to snag one of the three tables in a gazebo outside. 

The waiting staff gave us good tips and we ended up sharing the best bruschetta I’ve ever tasted and an incredible tagliatelle with mushrooms and fresh truffle as a starter. My mum was steered to have her carbonara made with fresh pasta, I chose gnocchi with Parmesan cream and truffle and my daughter chose the mushroom lasagne. All three mains were delicious but the mushroom lasagne was simply incredible. 

My family have apologised for doubting me and agree that it was well worth going a bit out of our way for such an amazing meal.More",50,November 2022,IN,BelleBuon
"I ordered food with my girlfriend at this place because we saw what people were eating at the outside part of the restaurant. Before ordering, we asked waiter if we needed to book a table, he quickly checked and invited us to sit down. The...service was very nice and humble, since we sat down we got all needed information about the food and drinks. They all looked so happy and had so much positive energy, very friendly! 

She ordered pasta (don't remember the name) but it was really HUGE portion of fresh delicious pasta with some deep flavoured sauce and meat chunks.  She gives it a 10 because it was only like 15€ but it feelt like 25-30€ pasta with that portion! 

I ordered Lasagna (also forgot the name, but the waiter was recommending it). I got schocked when it came fresh inside  ""porcelain?"" baking mold. So tasty with fresh Mozarella and Parmegiano, combined with pork meat was so delicious, yummy, deep in flavours and layed really good down inside my stomach! Also, price was super pleasant. For fresh and deep flavoured lasagna i only paid 15€. 

I am also Polish so needed some alcohol, their Tequila shots are pretty good aswell as wine if you know which one you like!

"Walked up on a Friday evening at 7:00 in hopes to get a table and while they are mostly booked, they let a few of us without reservations sit outside as long as we knew our tables were booked about an hour later. Sergi was...my server and was great! He helped me decide which pasta to order (got the recommended truffle pasta) and which wine to have. Topped it off with a shot of limoncello and it was overall a lovely dinner. I would recommend. I asked about reservations as they are pretty strict about it and was told you have to call to make one so just some helpful info!More",50,November 2022,IN,BelleBuon

The...selection of steak cuts was impressive and when you look at the menu don’t worry if the steaks don’t look that big… there is more than enough when you get it out on the table. We saw a guy order one of the larger plates of varying cuts and it looked massive!!!! 

We ordered two different cuts and halved them to try both. They were absolutely sensational. Cooked to perfection for me and we both like medium done steaks.

We went for the meal option including the meat platter, and added Crema Cataluna for dessert. 
The...food was outstanding and the service was excellent.

"Excellent food and excellent service. 
It was suggested for two people that 6 dishes were enough, we were greedy and chose 7 and I’m so glad we did. Not that it wasn’t enough but the food was amazing. Best patatas bravas I’ve ever had. And...I’ve had numerous. The waiter suggested the slow cooked Iberian pork cheek and I can honestly say I understood why, I’m still salivating now the day after. I loved the fact that they brought out the lighter dishes first. The ingredients infused together worked really well and if we were here longer we would definitely return. Only here for two nights. A little gem in a big city with so much to choose from, we would highly recommendMore",50,February 2023,IN,Xera Restaurant
"Booked this restaurant in advance of weekend break off the back of the reviews on here.  Not disappointed.  The welcome we got, the service, food and wine were all to draw and extremely well priced.

This is not a place you would naturally stumble across...and would definitely miss if you were looking for something to eat so get it booked and go and have a try, you won’t be disappointed!More",50,February 2023,IN,Xera Restaurant

"Absolutely amazing experience! 
Xera together with Rao located opposite on the same street are owned by the same person who made those two places to the one of the best gourmet restaurants in Europe.
In terms of taste and fantasy level they could easily have...Michelin star if the concept wouldnt be so commercialized. Before the change Michelin was actively looking for such places and today to get a star is more about money the restaurant and major of the city will pay. 
Reccommend to try cevice with specially made celery sorbet, but also octopus, scallops and crema catalan with tangerine sorbet are extraordinary. 
Meat lovers will find something excellent as well. 
Wine selection is great and the service level top! 
Thank you, Nicolas! 
Better book well in advance over their web page because is not easy to get the table there...More",50,February 2023,IN,Xera Restaurant

It’s small inside but really cosy and has a nice atmosphere. The waiter we had Friday evening , didn’t catch his name (we sat upstairs) was such a good host. Now onto the food.. it was hands down the best tapas I’ve ever had. The pork cheek literally melted in your mouth & the duck was divine! The wine was also perfect! I’ve recommended this place to my friends who are visiting Barcelona soon & we will definitely be back the next time we visit.More",50,January 2023,IN,Xera Restaurant

Very friendly staff. Great value for money, that’s why it...was full of both locals and tourists.More",50,January 2023,IN,Xera Restaurant
We had a very enjoyable meal of Tapas and Cava at Xera. Julian was attentive and informative and a lot of fun as well. He gave us some great advice to make sure we didn’t miss the Pork Cheek which melts in your mouth.  The...place is pretty small but they take reservations starting at 7:30 (good for those of us who haven’t adjusted to European dinner time). The evening was topped by an amazing slice of Torrija- melt in your mouth cake of some sort with caramel and ice cream - and a homemade “digestive” anise liquor in which Julian shared a drink with us. It’s a casual place with a mix of locals and tourists from around the world. The octopus was “good” but not I’ve had better in Barcelona. Their Catalon bread was fantastic though. You should put this place on your list to try.More,50,January 2023,IN,Xera Restaurant

"Friendly, welcoming multilingual staff and good pizza. It reminded us of Italian restaurants in Brooklyn in the 1950’s and 1960’s—and that’s a good thing. Certainly not the best Italian food from a three star Italian restaurant but good, honest cooking from a somewhat limited menu....Went on a Sunday night.

"Visited this restaurant off the strength of the reviews, first time was disappointed as fully booked but make a reservation for another night and wasn’t disappointed.

Although it’s a really small restaurant and tight on space, the quality of food certainly hit the spot. Varied...menu and a range of shareable dishes at great prices that were less than other not so good restaurants

We had a pizza and a pasta dish both were great even if they took quite a while to arrive, but during the wait they brought some nibbles for free which was a nice touch

Even though this place uses similar logo to Bella italia in the U.K. the quality of food is many times better as well as the staff focus.

No English menu but that was easily dealt with by using Google translate

"Amable, help a lot to organize, flexible, super efficients for this group dinner (30 pax). They helped all the way and more than anything the food was super good, delicious, more than abundant and 8 think the 30 participanta will go back there individually. the...options available are plenty, plates came out on time and hot, and super good with a list twist of something in every dish.
They made the organization of that dinner super easy and were always very amable understanding the last minute changes.
Staff in the management and service were great and were on top of all the details.

I recommend for sure for group dinners and probably as well nice more private dinners.More",50,February 2023,IN,9 Nine

"Having read the reviews and seeing that there was a variety on the menu I really wanted to go here for my partners birthday during our trip to Barcelona and was so happy when we got a booking. The restaurant itself looks lovely and the...staff are very accommodating as soon as you walk in. We decided to go with the nine menu , 3 courses and two drinks at a very reasonable 42 euros which was well worth the value at everything we had with such great quality. Everything we ordered we devoured and finished, everything was delicious, and nothing needed seasoning which for me is uncommon! The steak and ribs are to die for, and the desert was incredible. 
The staff were so lovely to go that extra mile too for my partners birthday without even having to ask, by bringing out a desert and candle and putting on birthday music. The experience was wonderful and we will remember the food,  thank you very much! Highly reccomend !!!More",50,January 2023,IN,9 Nine

"We found 9 Nine on TripAdvisor and its high TA rating is well deserved!  Nice atmosphere, great service and outstanding food!  We opted for the pre-fixe which is an amazing deal at 41 Euro each and allows you a great selection of appetizers, entrees and...desserts.  We had a selection of 3 appetizers and had the croquette ham & chicken, Iberian ham plate, and toast & ham appetizer--all were amazing.  For entrees we had the rabbit and chicken paella, and my wife had the ham steak--again, both were outstanding.  The paella was as good as I have had anywhere in the world.  We finished with the molten chocolate cake and crème brûlée!  After the meal, the Chef brought a glass of Harveys for each of us.  Overall dining experience was outstanding--great food, nice selection of options for each course, and great service.  I highly recommend.  Again, the value for the quality of the food was outstanding.  Not to be missed!More",50,December 2022,IN,9 Nine

"The Faire restaurant in Barcelona offers a delightful brunch experience that has something for everyone… who loves vegetarian food. From savory dishes like eggs Benedict, to sweet treats like cheesecakes and fruitbowls. you are sure to find something to satisfy your appetite.

The atmosphere is...both relaxed and inviting, and the staff is friendly and helpful. The decor is modern and stylish yet cozy, with plenty of comfortable seating. 
The food is of excellent quality and expertly prepared. The eggs Benedict that I had, is exceptionally tasty and cooked to perfection. The crepes are also delicious, with a variety of savory and sweet fillings to choose from. 
The drinks selection is also impressive. I am a kombucha fan, so I was happy with my tasteful rosemary, mint, lavender combination. 
Overall, the Faire is a great spot for brunch in Barcelona. The food is top-notch, the drinks are well-crafted, and the atmosphere is relaxed and inviting. Whether you're looking for a leisurely meal or a quick snack, the Faire is sure to please. And next to their customers, they’re also very earth friendly. So it’s a win-win for everyone!More",50,February 2023,IN,Faire Brunch & Drinks
"Enjoyed a delicious brunch here. Chose the ‘Popeye’. Essentially eggs on spinach, avocado on the side. Not easy to make spinach flavoursome but whoever cooked this knew what they were doing. Came with toast on the side. Not just any toast. This was the perfect...grainy wholemeal, toasted to crispy perfection. 
Had a cuppa tea too. Wanted ordinary….not available here! Assam in a test tube to infuse no less. Big bowl of it, on a saucer with various trimmings such as a bit of honey on the spoon with some lavender just in case I wanted to stir it in. Other options on the saucer were a white chocolate button and mint leaf and was that a bit of cinnamon? There was clearly an artist on duty. 
My charming waiter didn’t bat an eyelid  when I asked for a little bit of cold milk on the side. At that point I hadn’t realised quite what I’d ordered so at least I didn’t feel too Philistine-like. 
Then there is the decor……retro heaven. Menu QRs on cassettes/Sophia Loren’s cookery book/flat cap on a hat stand etc. Loved the lighting in particular. 
Just one thing, as per usual
in Barcelona as I was solo I was directed to the area opposite the bar to perch on a stool. Why is this?  I’m not a bird I don’t want to perch. My request for a table was accommodated v courteously though - as was the request by a fellow. I did feel a bit apprehensive that a larger group might come in though and that I may have to move. 
Maybe they knew what they were doing though….I may have ended up staying overnight….the music is fab! I defy anyone not to enjoy it. 
Maybe fewer large tables? Maybe start a campaign against directing solo eaters to perches? This place exudes too much classy perfection for that. 
And, just to hit this point home, every bill paid means a tree is planted! 
Love this place. Only open Thurs-Sun according to the website. Whaaat?!More",50,November 2021,IN,Faire Brunch & Drinks

The atmosphere was cozy and inviting, with a mixture of vintage and modern décor and the service was warm and friendly. The menu offered a nice...selection of brunch favourites and I decided to go with the avocado toast and tofu scramble with a side salad. It was a generous portion, but the meal didn’t feel heavy, and it was all really fresh and tasty. I also tried an Upraising coffee with active mushrooms and nootropics. Everything was soooo good. Overall, I highly recommend this brunch spot. The food was excellent, the service was great, and the atmosphere was enjoyable.

We chose this restaurant based on the reviews and we don’t regret it at all.

Good value, freshly made for us, piping hot and taste great. Our favourites were the Pulled fiction...& chicky pesto - prefect!! There are a few more options including vegan. Plus chilled beers in the fridge and if you need something sweet they sell cheesecakes in jars.

It’s a takeaway mostly, just a couple of stools whilst you wait for your order. Also there is a park area a few minutes walk away with several benches. 

They haven’t been open long and are clearly working really hard. We are going back to Barcelona soon and will definitely be returning to Tinos.More",50,August 2022,IN,"Tino, esto no es una pizzería"

It was such a treat discovering Tino because I quickly found one of my favorite delicious food places in Barcelona. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The dough is handmade through the day and the tinos are served fresh out of the oven. I...would recommend trying more than one because you will definitely want more. I got the 4 pack and they were so tasty I ate all four! They have options for vegan tinos as well which are just as delicious.

"My first ever visit to Barcelona, and as part of a business meeting, I met two colleagues from the UK.  This restaurant was booked due to its great reviews.

I have to say that this was was one of the, if not the best ever...meal I have had. From the start, the lovely hostess was friendly, there when you needed but just let us get on with our business meal. The quality of the food was amazing and the wine match was just superb.

If you are in Barcelona and looking for an amazing event for dinner, DO go to this restaurant.. It is AMAZING.

I could go on for ages, but simply go… I hope I get the chance to return here one day.. Thank you so muchMore",50,November 2022,IN,Con Gracia

"There are few dining experiences that can truly be called “perfect,” but our dinner at Con Gracia was most certainly one of them. Con Gracia offers a selection of tasting menus from which we chose the surprise menu- chefs choice- and were we in for...a treat. Each course offered perfectly balanced flavor, texture and color.

The restaurant is on a quiet street away from crowds, but very easy to get to. When we arrived early for our...reservation we were greeting warmly by Jose and taken to our table after only a short wait. 

The food was well-prepared, beautifully presented, and delicious.  Each course came with a short explanation on what we were about to eat.  Both Jose and Sabrina were fabulous! One of us got the wine pairings and those were excellent as well.  

In short, make a reservation and EAT HERE... you won't regret it.More",50,October 2022,IN,Con Gracia

"We loved Con Gracia for three things in particular: the divine food, with creative combinations and excellent presentation, the wine pairings, highlighting the best flavors and minerality of wines from the Catalan region and elsewhere in the E.U., and above all, the service.  Jose and...Sabrina were such an engaging duo, offering just the right amount of intelligence about the food and wine. Cheers to the artistry of the chef and kitchen staff. We would recommend Con Gracia to everyone.More",50,September 2022,IN,Con Gracia
Wow ! A wonderful dining  experience. 3 separate degustation menus available. Each 5 course. One is a surprise from the chef when he teases you into guessing ingredients and flavours. Wine pairings are bang on - from low volume local producers. All dishes are extremely...well presented- art on a plate. A great combination of flavours and textures. A short cab ride from Central hotels. It really is worth making  that journey.More,50,September 2022,IN,Con Gracia
"We went to this restaurant based on good ranking in TripAdvisor and we certainly were not disappointed. 
We both chose the surprise menu and my wife also tried the wine pairing.
All the dishes were interesting, original, and delicious ( all portions were small, but...adequate to appreciate the presentation and flavors and sufficiently satisfying).
The atmosphere is quite intimate, with only a few tables in the dining area.
José was an excellent host and he was even kind enough to leave the restaurant premises to find us a cab to get us back to our place.
Would go back. Highly recommended.More",50,September 2022,IN,Con Gracia
"This is a special place and experience. We had an unforgettable meal here . I have gluten issues and they made sure my entire tasting was free of gluten. Also they baked me fresh bread that I could enjoy. Sabrina was a gem and took...care of us so beautifully.

My wine pairing was also an incredible experience. I would recommend this to anyone going to Barcelona, with thousands of places to eat, this is the best !More",50,September 2022,IN,Con Gracia

Very  good restaurant and good meat. The waiter Angel was very helpful and friendly.  Worth a visit to try the awesome parillas,40,February 2023,IN,Don Asador
"Small, unassuming restaurant, which I picked based on excellent reviews and didn't disappoint. I booked through a website which offered a 30% discount code which was a bonus, but to be honest the food is worth paying full price! I would recommend pre-booking simply because...it was packed even on a Tuesday night, and isn't a massive restaurant. 

When we arrived the service was friendly and personal, and continued that way the whole meal. I felt like they were genuinely delighted to have us there which makes the experience so much better!

We ordered mixed meats, grilled vegetables and one portion of fries. This was more than enough for two of us, it might even stretch to three! The vegetables selection was cooked beautifully, but the meat. WOW, some of the most delicious steak and other meats I'd ever eaten. The steak was so tender and great quality. 

We had food left over and as we were staying in self catering accommodation they parcelled it up and I took it home. The next day I had a steak sandwich, and the meat actually tasted even better than the day before! 

The toilet is accessible, and everything is on one level. They were welcoming of young families too. One of the best meals I've ever had.More",50,April 2022,IN,Don Asador

Food is very good but not sure why they take table bookings and make you wait outside for 50 mins and let walk ins go before you. Organisation of the tables and bookings is a bit of a mess.

"Great little restaurant with friendly, helpful staff and a nice atmosphere. We had the large tasting menu, and all the starters were great. The salmon tartar and the Locavore egg were outstanding - imaginatively presented, fresh and tasty.

Wasn't so impressed by the main courses....The turbot was dry with small bones in it, and it had quite a solid texture, maybe a bit over-cooked, the skin was jelly like and, not sure about the beef stock. The venison ribs were OK, just not special. 

Dessert was a big disappointment. The tiramisu was dry and tasteless, probably the worst tiramisu I've ever had. The cream dessert was OK, a bit heavy. All in all we had a good evening and enjoyed our meal, just a few of the dishes let it down.More",40,February 2023,IN,Locavore Barcelona

When we first arrived, we were struggling a bit with the menu as it was all in Spanish. However, the staff were very friendly and helped us a lot. We went for the large set menu (7 dishes and a bottle of wine)...which was great value and all the food was delicious!

"We went there hoping to discover local products during the whole meal but were a bit disappointed... I guess they try to use local products in their plates (though the ""foie mi cuit"" cooked with Coca Cola does not seem very aligned with that philosophy),...and the food was good. 
What was more disturbing was that when I asked for a soft drink, I was only suggested a Fanta or a Nestea... A pity when so many more local and healthier alternatives exist. At least the water was from the tap, hence local ;) 
Service was also a bit weird: e.g. we received an entrance (offered by the restaurant, which is nice) 2 minutes before our plate, which didn't leave us enough time to eat it!
In conclusion, a good restaurant with a concept only half exploited.More",30,November 2021,IN,Locavore Barcelona

"One of the reviews said next level sushi and that is definitely an accurate description! There is one table and about 5 bar seats available in the whole place so we reserved the table. There were 3 of us and we each got the 70EUpp...tasting menu. Every bit was so fresh and unbelievable. The only weird thing is I think they close at 4:00 and took us at 3:30(I didn’t know they closed at 4:00 until we got there). We probably would have ordered more food but one of the chefs rushed out and it just seemed like they wanted to close down which made it difficult to relax. They could not have been any friendlier. The place could not have been any cleaner. If you are used to eating a ton of sushi I could see the tasting maybe not being enough but it was plenty for me. One other difficult thing was the language barrier so just be aware of that if your Spanish isn’t great. But I honestly cannot say enough about this place, such a cool little experience.More",50,November 2022,IN,Jara Sushi Degustación

We chose to do...the tasting menu and pair it with a bottle of white Garnacha wine. Every single dish was amazing! You can probably close your eyes and point to an item on the menu and it will come out perfect. Also, don't leave without getting dessert!!!
To complete the trifecta, besides having amazing food and drinks, the ambiance did not leave us wanting. The decoration, music, and lighting of the restaurant were on point. 
If that was not enough, the service was also extremely friendly and helpful. They helped us through all of our choices and made sure our tasting menu came out seamlessly; we never felt rushed and we were never sitting there waiting a long time.   
SHOUT OUT TO VICTOR, JUDITE, AND ALEX FOR MAKING THIS A NIGHT TO REMEMBER!

I worked in the restaurant industry for 10 years. I am someone hard to impress and extremely picky. I was blown away by Babula Bar. Thank you very much!!More",50,October 2022,IN,Babula Bar 1937

"The decor of the restaurant is very on trend. As we waited for our table we met other guests who were already telling us what we needed to try and how much they loved the food. It is such a friendly place to come and...have dinner. Our waiter Santi made our night, what a great waiter. He not only explained the menu to us but was so fun and really added to the enjoyment of our experience there. While we were having dinner YOHITSOUND dj started playing from 23h. Once we finished dinner we got up and started dancing with other guests to some amazing music. Thank you for such a great night. I will be back for sure!More",50,January 2023,IN,Babula Bar 1937
"Good steak tartare and outstanding ""tataki de vaca"". Prices are maybe a little bit higher compared to the rest of the city, but the quality (including service) is definitely worth it. After all, tartar+tataki+wine+espresso for less than 50€ is not so much, here's not a...fast food, so really highly recommended!More",50,January 2023,IN,Babula Bar 1937

"We decided to walk down a side street away from the hustle and bustle of the Barcelona madness and we discovered this little hidden gem. From the moment we walked into the busy restaurant Jordi was just amazing and made us feel so welcome. He...could not do enough for us. We asked him for recommendations and he had so much time for us. He let us have a sample of house wine and the sangria before we bought ( they were both that nice that we bought them both). The food was absolutely stunning as were the drinks, especially the sangria. I would absolutely recommend this hidden little gem to anybody travelling to Barcelona who wants so traditional Spanish food. Between us we had Spanish tapas, paella (seafood and chicken) and we shared the local traditional pudding. Please go here and visit, you won’t be disappointed.More",50,November 2022,IN,Prado de Flores

"This place was so good I decided to visit a second time.

On the first occasion my friend and I had garlic prawns and croquettes. He then had a fish paella and I had ribs. Jordi our waiter recommended a local white wine that went...with both dishes.

I decided to return as they had a T-Bone Steak at a good price which was also really good and also had a chicken kebab starter and garlic mushrooms. On the second occasion I was looked after by Christal who was also excellent.

Will try to get there again the next time I'm in Barcelona.More",50,February 2023,IN,Prado de Flores

"My partner and I visited the festaursnt on our first day, but we were very disappointed

We were very hungry and wanted to eat a burger! We arrived there and immediately ordered. The two ‚Cheeseburgers' came after 30 min...
We saw that there was no...cheddar but blue cheese on the burger and we claimed that at the English menu it was written that the burger had cheddar but no blue cheese!
Then the chef came and took our burgers, but only put cheddar on these and didnt took the blue cheese away, so it tasted very bad!
We claimed that it wasnt the burgers that we ordered, but they only apologized and changed nothing!

The manager then contacted us to apogolize and invited us a second time to the restaurant. This time we got the burgers with cheddar and they were really tasty. The waitress was also super friendly. We were then very happy! Thank you!More",50,February 2023,IN,Prado de Flores

"Beautiful tapas bar with a great atmosphere. 

I was able to get a seat at the bar without having to wait but by the time I left it looked like there was a small queue. 

The staff were very attentive to me and helped me...choose some dishes. I was asked how my meal was and if I needed anything a few times which was appreciated. Service was very fast even though it was busy. 

Super reasonable prices too, €29 for three dishes (paella, garlic bread, and cod), a cocktail and a glass of wine.  

I will be visiting again when I’m in Barcelona again!More",50,February 2023,IN,Bodega Oliva

Each tapas dish we ordered was lovely in it's own personal way. The pork and mushrooms...were cooked to perfection and had a lovely sauce. The salmon and puree was delicious. The duck and mashed potato was equally delicious and the traditional Spanish omelette was one of the best ive ever eaten.
