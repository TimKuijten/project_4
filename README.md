####Restaurant reviews in different languages

The restaurant industry is strongly influenced by customer reviews, as they can have a significant impact on a restaurant's reputation and success. With the increasing globalization and multiculturalism of our society, it is common to see restaurant reviews written in different languages.

In this context, we will explore a dataset containing restaurant reviews in various languages, and investigate whether the language used in reviews affects their tone and ratings. Specifically, we will examine the following hypothesis:

- The language that leaves the lowest rated reviews, also has the most negative sentiment 
- When people leave a review of a cuisine from their own country, they are biased (French - French, Japanese - Japanese)
- Reviews in north-european languages have a more negative tone (Dutch, German, Norwegian, Swedish, Russian)
- Reviews in Asian languages are focused on other things that reviews in European languages.
